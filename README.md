# clevercozmo
A Python script I wrote to connect Cozmo with Cleverbot.
## How to Use
In order to use this script, you need to:
- Set Up the Cozmo SDK (Cozmo required): http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/
- Attain access to the CleverBot API: https://www.cleverbot.com/api/
- Run 'pip3 install cleverwrap' to install the CleverWrap library.
- Run 'pip3 install speech_recognition' to install the Speech Recognition libray.
- Download the both 'clevercozmo.py' and 'voiceParse.py' and put them in the same folder together.
- On line 7 of 'clevercozmo.py', put your API key in between the quotes. You can find your key here: https://www.cleverbot.com/api/my-account/
- Set up your Cozmo to run in SDK Mode
- Run the script with 'py clevercozmo.py'
- Enjoy!
